# Troubleshooting

## The Install Button Doesn't Detect My Device

- Make sure you're using **Chrome or Edge** on a desktop computer. Mobile browsers and Safari/Firefox don't support the required browser feature (WebSerial).
- Try a **different USB-C cable**. Charge-only cables won't work.
- Try a **different USB port** on your computer.
- On Windows, you may need to install drivers — check Device Manager for an unrecognised device.

## The Display Is Stuck on the Loading Screen

- Give it up to 60 seconds after first boot. It needs time to connect to WiFi and download resources.
- If it stays on the loading screen, power-cycle it and check whether the WiFi hotspot appears. If it does, the display couldn't connect to your network — go through the WiFi setup again.
- If you need to report the problem, collect a startup log with the [USB log guide](/getting-started/collect-usb-logs) and include it in the GitHub issue.

## Home Assistant Doesn't Discover the Device

- Make sure the display and Home Assistant are on the **same WiFi network** (not a guest network or a different VLAN).
- In Home Assistant, go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration** and search for **ESPHome**. Enter the device's IP address manually.

## Home Assistant Doesn't Respond to Button Presses

- If the display shows your Home Assistant devices but nothing happens when you tap buttons, switches, lights, scripts, scenes, or other controls, Home Assistant actions probably need to be enabled for the display.
- Follow the [Enable Actions](/getting-started/home-assistant-actions) guide and make sure **Allow the device to perform Home Assistant actions** is turned on.

## The Web Page Looks Broken or Unstyled

- The device's web page loads some resources from the internet. Make sure the display has a working internet connection (not just local network access).
- Try clearing your browser cache and reloading.

## I Want to Start Over

- To re-flash the firmware, connect via USB-C and use the [install button](/getting-started/install#flash-the-firmware) again.
- To clear WiFi settings and start fresh, re-flash the device. It will create the setup hotspot again.

## I Need Help With a Bug

- Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jtenniswood/espcontrol/issues/new) and describe the display model, firmware version, and what happened.
- For startup, WiFi, loading screen, or Home Assistant connection problems, include a USB log from the [Collect USB Logs](/getting-started/collect-usb-logs) guide.
